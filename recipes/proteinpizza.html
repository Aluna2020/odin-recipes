    <li>55 grams soy flour</li>
    <li>11 grams flour</li>
    <li>175 grams of water</li>

</ul>

<strong>Steps for mixing the dough</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Set a bowl over a scale. Add the flours, water, instant yeast, and salt. Mix with your hands or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook until no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes. If kneading by hand, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes. Once rested, or if using a stand mixer continue kneading the dough until it becomes smooth and passes the windowpane test. Let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap, and preferably, let cold ferment in the fridge for 24 to 120 hours (1 to 5 days). If cooking pinsa the same day, perform three sets of stretch and folds by folding the four edges of the dough up and back to the center, turning the dough over, and letting rest for 30 minutes before repeating 2 more times.</li>
    <li>At least 2 hours before you are ready to bake, separate the pizza dough into 5 equal pieces, roughly 185 g each. Pull the edges of the dough into the center and form a tight ball. Sprinkle some rice on your work surface or a baking sheet and place the ball on it. Repeat with each dough piece then sprinkle some more flour over top before covering with another baking sheet, plastic wrap, or a towel until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Once almost doubled (about 2 hours), spread the dough into roughly an oval shape by using your fingertips to gently stretch and pull until roughly 12 inches long and 6 inches wide.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Steps for baking</strong>
<ol>
    <li>preheat the oven the highest it will go, likely 500 to 550 F. Place the shaped pizza on an aluminum baking screen and add the toppings of your choice. Once preheated, bake until evenly browned and crisp. Depending on the oven this could be 4-8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Let cool a bit before slicing and enjoy.</li>
